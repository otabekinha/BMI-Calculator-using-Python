# BMI-Calculator-using-Python
Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

## What is BMI?

* The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

* The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

## Example Input

* ```
  weight = 77
  height = 1.80
  ```

## Example Output

* ```
  77 รท (1.80 x 1.80) = 77 รท 3.24 = 23.7654321...
  24
  ```

## HINT

* Check the data type of the inputs.
* Try to use the exponent operator in your code.
* Remember PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction)
* Remember to convert your result to a whole number (int).
